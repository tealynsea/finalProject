finalProject
============
This is the web application I developed as a final project at RefactorU.
It's designed to help connect women who want to find a mentor as well as women who want to mentor aspiring
coders.

I used Javascript/jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap3 on the front-end.  I used node.js and mongoDB on the backend.

You can find the app on blooming-cliffs-4427.herkuapp.com
